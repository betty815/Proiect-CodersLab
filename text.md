Ghenie 

In his darkly disturbing works, Cluj School painter Adrian Ghenie weaves together personal and collective memories and fears to address the traumas of 20th-century European history. Recalling the textural richness of Northern European Renaissance painting, Ghenie depicts figurative imagery in contrasting states of clarity, fluidity, and decay, dripping and pouring paint, scraping surfaces, and deploying strong chiaroscuro. His works reveal a preoccupation with 20th-century political and scientific ideologies, such as Communism and eugenics, and references to figures like Marcel Duchamp, German SS officer and physician Josef Mengele, and Charles Darwin figure heavily in his oeuvre.

Fota

Victor Fota was born in 1989, he is from Bucharest, Romania. He’s a visual artist, graduate of Fine Arts High School “Nicolae Tonitza”, has a Bachelor and Master degree in Art History. His works are separated in three major concepts; “Two Grounds” which was the first personal exhibition in Bucharest, “Reality through Reason-Cosmogony” the second one, and “Human Extension” which is in progress and will be displayed in 2016 at Galateca gallery in Bucharest.
 
The most recent series of oil paintings, have a concept based on the relation of man and machine, called Human Extension, in which the artist explores this relationship using facts and imagination, resulting in a surreal image.

Edith

At the crossroads between abstract and figurative, the show, which features a selection of the last three series of works made between 2017 and 2019, undertakes a journey in the bizarre universe of urban periphery, in the attempt to allegorically recompose the devastating effects of junk invasion and consumerism on our living space.

Edith Torony’s works allude to any peripheric urban area of our globalized world: what mostly strikes in these almost surrealist compositions, with insertions of pop art, is their strange and familiar air. While looking at them, you cannot but recognize objects, fragments or just allusions to everything that in our urban space is identified as surplus, useless or superfluous. That is, the reminiscences of consumerism, of which we don’t know how to get rid of as soon as possible, and which, most of the times, end by being exiled at the margins of our world, extra muros.

Caltia

Caltia works in a ‘magical realist’ style, though he does not fit into any label easily, with meticulous craft and reverence for technique. In addition to paintings, he also produces drawings and etchings; more recently, in 2010, he painted a series on porcelain, inspired by the vegetation of Sona. He works on small surfaces in a highly detailed manner. His work is realistic but also fantastic.

He paints a range of themes: sober landscapes, still lives, burlesque characters, humans metamorphosing into strange creatures, and plays with ideas such as doubt, allusion, insinuation, seriousness, malice and happiness. Caltia’s visual and typological universe (of the clown, the divinizer, the floating woman, the unicorn, the gardener) is rooted in dreaming and childhood memories, and points, implicitly but intentionally, towards a mystical model of humanity in Christ. Much of this can be considered a monologue on the earthly condition of existence.

Coma

Described as one of the country's best-known artists of the present day, he had a solo exhibition at the National Museum of Contemporary Art in the autumn of 2011.
